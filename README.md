# Elm "solutions" to Advent of Code 2019

[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is out and I'm giving
it a shot in Elm

You didn't think procedural Elm was possible well I did it on day 2, so deal with it.

To run these I'm just doing `elm reactor`, but you can check them out in Ellie below

1. Both <https://ellie-app.com/7nLM5gYnvpwa1>
2. First <https://ellie-app.com/7pGR5FP5B4qa1> Second <https://ellie-app.com/7pdYqnSpvPda1>
3. Both <https://ellie-app.com/7pGSVjCHMkHa1> but sorted by the second step value.
  Also I want to redo this one it's too wild.
  Also drop that first row obviously.

To be continued

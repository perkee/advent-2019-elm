# Elm "solutions" to Advent of Code 2019

[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) is out and I'm giving
it a shot in Elm. I'm going as slow as I want because this is supposed to be fun
and what's NOT fun is being glued to my computer with people around me.

You didn't think procedural Elm was possible well I did it on day 2, so deal with it.

To run these I'm just doing `elm reactor`, but you can check them out in Ellie below

1. Both <https://ellie-app.com/7nLM5gYnvpwa1>
2. First <https://ellie-app.com/7pGR5FP5B4qa1> Second <https://ellie-app.com/7pdYqnSpvPda1>
3. Both <https://ellie-app.com/7pGSVjCHMkHa1> but sorted by the second step value.
  Also I want to redo this one it's too wild.
  Also drop that first row obviously.
4. Part 1 <https://ellie-app.com/7pTWm9tvYZta1> Part 2 which also solves 1 without all that parsing: <https://ellie-app.com/7pTVkDcqJsca1>
5. Both <https://ellie-app.com/7qZYh78CnfBa1>
  really need to update the display to only highlight relevant cells but I have a feeling we'll come back to this
6. <https://ellie-app.com/7sV3BswXv8Xa1> Cannot believe how much I overthought this
7. Part 1 <https://ellie-app.com/7tR9NVgzzYBa1>
8. <https://ellie-app.com/7sgSmvhn42Qa1>
9. <https://ellie-app.com/7s68TGXmKWxa1> Had to make it run faster (100k recursions per cycle) so I cannot render memory while it is running.
10. Not yet
11. <https://ellie-app.com/7sKFHT6hDLpa1> Only part 2 runs in Ellie, part 1 passes the maximum stack call size, kind of interesting.
